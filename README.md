# Ian Collins
My name is Ian, and I'm a Software Developer. I have graduated Keyin College's Software Development program in April 2023, and started the GetCoding program in December 2023. I enjoy learning more languages and framworks to make myself a stronger developer.

## Skills and Experience
### Keyin College
* During our first semester, we started with Python and had a final project in which we made a robot simulate search and rescue efforts. The robot would look for rooms, enter them, and determine the best course of action. If it was a room marked as "fire", it would simulate using an extinguisher. If a room was marked "Poison", it would sound an alarm and vacate the room. Finally, if it found a person inside, it would guide them back to the starting point and resume it's operations on to the next rooms left unsearched.
* The second semester was learning HTML, CSS, react and UI/UX design.
* The third semester was more focused on JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and databases such as MondoDB and SQL. I was taught more of the fundementals of building interactive code in a more object oriented fashion. My final project utilized Express.JS and both a MongoDB and SQL database.
* The fourth semester was focused on Java, DevOps, and Software Design, Architecture and Testing (SDAT). In my SDAT course, I learnt about how to more properly structure code and Unit Testing. The final project was a group project in which we created a fully functional webpage that used Java and SpringBoot in the back-end, with React.js in the front end. It used an SQL database and was fully deployed through AWS services.
* From the second semester on, we were also taught about AWS and how to use it's services.

### Since Graduating
* I have continued my education by learning more things such as C#, .NET, Kotlin, and Jetpack Compose.
* I picked up the Unity Engine and made a small mini-game that has you control a ship that fires at enemies opposite you while dodging their attacks (much like Space Invader).
* After starting a new campaign in the Starfinder Tabletop RPG with some friends, I found a need for an app to manage spells. When I found none existed, I learnt how to make it. I taught myself Kotlin with Jetpack Compose annotation through the help of online resources, and currently working on getting the app into the Google Play Store. The code for this app can be found here -> [Spell Tablet](https://github.com/Col-Ian/SpellListApplication)
* I am currently registered as a mentor for the Canada Learning Code program. In this role I am able to sign up for any upcomming events and act as an aid to the instructor.

### GetCoding
* In December 2023, I started the GetCoding program to gain some practical experience and learn how to overall become a better developer.
